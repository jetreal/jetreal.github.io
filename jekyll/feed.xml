Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the
edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</p>

<p>The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of
a large hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm
(1.8–2.2 in) in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin
and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible
seeds. The fruit has a soft texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[layout: post author: ted — Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Apples</title><link href="https://jetreal.github.io/jekyll/jekyll/2018/apples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apples" /><published>2018-08-12T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-08-12T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://jetreal.github.io/jekyll/jekyll/2018/apples</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jetreal.github.io/jekyll/jekyll/2018/apples.html"><![CDATA[<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>

<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown
